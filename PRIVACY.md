# Privacy Policy for Dither Extension

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026

## Overview

The Dither extension is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension processes all images locally in your browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any user data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any user data.** Specifically:

- No personally identifiable information
- No browsing history
- No website content or images
- No user activity or behavior tracking
- No authentication credentials
- No location data
- No financial information
- No health information

## How the Extension Works

The Dither extension:

1. **Runs locally**: All image processing happens entirely within your browser
2. **No external communication**: The extension does not connect to any external servers or services
3. **No data storage**: Processed images are only stored temporarily in your browser's memory and are discarded when you navigate away or restore the original images
4. **User-initiated**: The extension only processes images when you explicitly click the extension button

## Permissions Explanation

### Content Scripts (`<all_urls>`)
The extension requires permission to inject scripts on any webpage so that it can identify and process images on websites you choose to visit. The content script remains idle until you explicitly activate the extension by clicking its button.

### Active Tab (`activeTab`)
This permission allows the extension popup to communicate with the currently active tab to trigger image processing. It is only used when you interact with the extension.

## Third-Party Services

The Dither extension does not:
- Use any third-party analytics services
- Connect to any external APIs
- Share data with any third parties
- Include any tracking pixels or cookies
- Load any remote code or resources (except for bundled extension resources served from the extension itself)

## Data Security

Since no data is collected, stored, or transmitted, there are no data security concerns related to external storage or transmission. All processing occurs within your browser's secure sandbox environment.

## Children's Privacy

This extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13.
